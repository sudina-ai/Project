    <h1>Manicure</h1>
    <p>
    <h2>A manicure is a mostly cosmetic beauty treatment for the fingernails and hands performed at home or in a nail
        salon. A manicure usually consists of filing and shaping the free edge of nails, pushing and clipping (with a
        cuticle pusher and cuticle nippers) any nonliving tissue at the cuticle and removing hangnails, treatments with
        various liquids, massage of the hand, and the application of fingernail polish.[1] When the same is applied to
        the toenails and feet, the treatment is referred to as a pedicure. Together, the treatments may be known as a
        mani-pedi.

        Some manicures include painting pictures or designs on the nails, applying small decals, or imitation jewels
        (from 2 dimension to 3 dimension). Other nail treatments may include the application of artificial gel nails,
        tips, or acrylics, which may be referred to as French manicures.[2]

        Nail technicians, such as manicurists and pedicurists, must be licensed in certain states and countries, and
        must follow government regulations.[3] Since skin is manipulated and often times trimmed, there is a risk of
        spreading infection when tools are used across many people. Therefore, having improper sanitation can pose
        serious issues.[4]</h2><br>

        <h2 style="background-color: aliceblue;">Manicures have become an essential part of many individuals' personal
            grooming routines. These beauty treatments involve the shaping, filing, and painting of the nails, as well
            as the care and maintenance of the hands and nails. Many people view manicures as a form of self-care and
            relaxation, and they can also be an important part of one's overall appearance and presentation.</h2>

    <h2> There are several different types of manicures that individuals can choose from, each offering its own unique
        benefits. A basic manicure typically includes the trimming and shaping of the nails, as well as cuticle care and
        a hand massage. This type of manicure is perfect for individuals who want to maintain the health and appearance
        of their nails without any frills or special treatments.

        For those who want to add a splash of color to their nails, a traditional manicure with nail polish is the way
        to go. This type of manicure includes all of the basic nail care steps, followed by the application of a base
        coat, two coats of nail polish, and a top coat for added shine and protection. The color options are endless,
        ranging from classic shades such as red or nude to bold and vibrant hues.

        In recent years, gel and shellac manicures have also gained popularity. These types of manicures involve the
        application of a special gel or shellac polish, which is cured under a UV or LED light to create a long-lasting,
        chip-resistant finish. Many individuals opt for these types of manicures to ensure that their nail color lasts
        for weeks without chipping or peeling.

        Another popular and luxurious type of manicure is the spa manicure, which includes all of the basic nail care
        steps as well as exfoliation, moisturization, and a paraffin wax treatment for the hands. This type of manicure
        is perfect for individuals who want to indulge in a relaxing and pampering experience while also maintaining the
        health and appearance of their nails.

        In addition to the aesthetic benefits, manicures also offer several health benefits. Regular manicures can help
        to prevent nail damage, dryness, and breakage, as well as promote healthy cuticles and nail growth. The massage
        and moisturization involved in a manicure can also improve blood circulation and promote relaxation.

        Overall, manicures are a popular and essential part of many individuals' beauty and self-care routines. Whether
        it's a basic manicure to maintain the health of the nails, a traditional manicure with nail polish for a pop of
        color, or a luxurious spa manicure for a pampering experience, there are options to suit everyone's preferences
        and needs. With the numerous benefits that manicures offer, it's no wonder that they have become such a staple
        in the beauty industry.</h2>
