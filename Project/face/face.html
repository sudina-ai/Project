    <h1 style="color: rgb(135, 69, 80);">Keep Your Skin Healthy</h1>
    <p>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(218, 83, 83);">People say that beauty’s only skin deep; it’s what’s on the “inside” that
        counts. Our insides are certainly important, but skin is your first layer of defense against the outside world.
        Skin can also give important clues to your overall health. Learn to take good care of your skin, so your skin
        can keep taking good care of you.

        Skin protects your body in many ways. “The skin provides a barrier to protect the body from invasion by bacteria
        and other possible environmental hazards that can be dangerous for human health,” says NIH dermatologist Dr.
        Heidi Kong.

        Skin plays other roles, too. It contains nerve endings that let you feel when an object is too hot or sharp, so
        you can quickly pull away. Sweat glands and tiny blood vessels in your skin help to control your body
        temperature. And cells in your skin turn sunlight into vitamin D, which is important for healthy bones.

        Skin can also alert you to a health problem. A red, itchy rash might signal allergies or infections, and a red
        “butterfly” rash on your face might be a sign of lupus. A yellow tint might indicate liver disease. And dark or
        unusual moles might be a warning sign of skin cancer. Be on the lookout for unexpected changes to your skin, and
        talk with your doctor if you have concerns.

        Your skin can become too dry if you don’t drink enough fluids or spend too much time in sunny or dry conditions.
        “While washing hands is important for good hygiene, washing your hands too much can also lead to dry skin,” Kong
        says, especially if you wash with hot water and harsh soaps. To treat dry skin, use moisturizing creams or
        lotions, and use warm instead of hot water when you bathe and wash your hands. You can also try using a
        humidifier to make the air in your home less dry.

        The sun can damage your skin as well. Sunlight contains ultraviolet (UV) light that causes sunburn and makes
        your skin age faster, leading to more wrinkles as you get older. “There’s a strong link between UV exposure and
        skin cancer,” Kong adds. So protect your skin from the sun. Wear hats and other protective clothing, use
        sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and restrict your time in the sun during the late
        morning and early afternoon hours, when sunlight is strongest.

        Many skin researchers like Kong are studying the skin’s microbiome—the bacteria and other microscopic organisms
        that live on your skin. Some of these microbes can be helpful. Evidence suggests that they boost the body’s
        infection-fighting immune system and help keep you healthy. “But there are some skin diseases with known
        associations with certain microbes,” says Kong. “We’re trying to understand how those microbes differ between
        healthy people and people with skin diseases.” In the long run, scientists would like to find ways to support
        healthy skin microbes while reducing harmful ones.</h3>

    <h1 style="color: rgb(200, 49, 74);"> A good face care routine includes:</h1><br>
    <h4>1.Cleansing</h4><br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(218, 83, 83);">Use a gentle cleanser and warm water to wash your face. Avoid rubbing your skin
        with a towel, instead pat it dry.</h3><br>
    <h4>2.Moisturizing</h4><br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(218, 83, 83);">Moisturizer helps protect your skin from losing moisture and keeps it feeling
        supple. Look for ingredients like Vitamin E, Glycerin, Pro-Vitamin B5, and Borage Seed Oil.</h3><br>
    <h4>3.Sun protection</h4><br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(218, 83, 83);"> Wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30 whenever you're outdoors to protect your
        skin from the sun's harmful UV rays.</h3><br>
    <h4>4.Face masks</h4><br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(218, 83, 83);">Use a clay mask for oily skin, a hydrating mask for dry skin, or a sheet mask
        for a quick refresh. Use 1-2 times a week after exfoliating.</h3><br>
    <h4>5.Serums</h4><br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(218, 83, 83);">Serums are water-based droplets with powerful skincare ingredients.</h3><br>
    <h4>6.Toner</h4><br>
    <h3 style="color: rgb(218, 83, 83);">Astringents like toner can help shrink pores. Apply it after cleansing, as a
        second step in readying your face for sunscreen and moisturizer.</h3><br>

            <h1 style="background-color: rgb(203, 44, 71);"> if you have sensitive skin, you can try to avoid products
                with alcohol, soap, acid, or fragrance. Instead, look for calming ingredients like aloe, chamomile,
                green tea polyphenols, and oats.<br></h1>
