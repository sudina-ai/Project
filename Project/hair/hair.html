        <p>Do you know as much as your eyes convey what’s going on in your mind, your hair reveals a lot about your
            personality? The more attention a person pays to their hair, the more vocal their hair become.<br>
            Hair is one of the key components of a person's aesthetic as it not only enhances your appearance but makes
            you look more spick and span. It's one of the first things people notice during the first meeting. Everyone
            adores and admires hair. And who doesn’t loves to post images of their unkempt hair on social media
            platforms like Instagram or Facebook with some New Hair Captions? Of course, we all love to do that!<br>
            Not just a picture but a cute hair care quote can also get you more likes and follows.</p>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">A hair care routine can include:</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(185, 45, 68)"> Washing: Washing your hair regularly removes dirt, oil, and product buildup,
            which can clog pores and hair follicles. Washing your hair frequently can also reduce dandruff and breakage.
            However, washing your hair too often can remove natural oils, so you should wash less frequently depending
            on your hair type and personal preference. <br>
            Conditioning: Conditioning helps detangle, seal cuticles, and replenish moisture. Apply conditioner to wet
            hair, focusing on the mid-lengths and ends, and leave it on for 1–2 minutes before rinsing with cool water.
            Hair mask: A weekly hair mask can provide deep conditioning for dry, damaged, or rough hair.<br>
            Brushing: Brushing your hair removes tangles and distributes natural oils.<br>
            Sleeping: Avoid sleeping with wet hair because your hair is weakest when it's wet. <br>
            Trimming: Regular trims can help preserve curl patterns and promote healthier hair growth.<br> </p>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Help! My Hair is Tangled</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(185, 45, 68)">Dreadlocked stars such as Lenny Kravitz might embrace their stylishly tangled
            hair. But most of us groan in frustration when we're faced with a mass of tangled hair.

            The key to preventing tangles is to reduce the amount of chemicals (dyes, relaxers, perms) that you put in
            your hair, and to use a good conditioner in the shower. Also, make sure your hair is tangle-free before you
            wash it.

            Avoid brushing out tangles. Arm yourself with a wide-toothed comb, your fingers, and maybe a leave-in
            detangler that you can buy at any drug store. Start by gently picking out the tangles at the ends of your
            hair to avoid pulling out the hair. Once the ends are manageable, move your way up toward the scalp, gently
            combing.

            Above all, remain calm. If you hurry, the tangles could get worse, resulting in a brush or comb full of
            stray hairs.</p>

        <p style="color:rgb(185, 45, 68)">In our quest for beautiful hair, we often do things that damage our hair.
            Damaged hair is fragile, so it tends to break. Hair breakage can leave us with frizzy, unhealthy looking
            hair. If we continue to damage our hair, we may eventually see thinning hair or even bald spots.<br>The good
            news is that simple changes can prevent further hair damage. Here you’ll find 10 common hair care practices
            that can damage hair and dermatologists’ tips that can help you to stop the damage.<br>
        <p style="color:rgb(185, 45, 68)">
            <b> 1.Washing your hair by rubbing shampoo into the length of your hair. Changes that can help prevent hair
                damage:</b><br>

            Gently massage shampoo into your scalp.<br>
            When you rinse the shampoo from your scalp, let it flow through the length of your hair and resist the
            temptation to rub it into your hair.<br>
            <b>2.Skipping the conditioner. Changes that can help prevent hair damage:</b><br>

            Use conditioner after every shampoo.<br>
            Dermatologists' recommendations for swimmers<br>
            <b>3.Pool chemicals can be hard on your hair. The following can help protect your hair: </b><br>

            Wear a swim cap.<br>
            Rinse hair immediately after swimming.<br>
            After rinsing your hair, wash your hair with a specially formulated swimmers’ shampoo and follow with a deep
            conditioner.<br>
            <b>4.Drying your hair by rubbing it with a towel. Changes that can help prevent hair damage:</b><br>

            Wrap your hair in a towel to absorb the water.<br>
            Let your hair air dry.<br>
            <b> 5.Brushing your hair while it is wet. Changes that can help prevent hair damage: </b><br>

            Do you have straight hair? Let your hair dry a bit before you gently comb it with a wide-tooth comb.<br>
            Do you have textured hair or tight curls? Always comb your hair while it is damp, using a wide-tooth
            comb.<br>
            <b>6.Using a blow dryer, hot comb, or curling iron. Changes that can help prevent hair damage:</b><br>

            Let your hair air dry when possible.<br>
            Use the lowest heat setting.<br>
            Limit the time a hot comb or curling iron touches your hair.<br>
            Use these tools less frequently, aiming for once a week — or even less often.<br>
            <b>7.Applying styling products that offer long-lasting hold. Changes that can help prevent hair
                damage:</b><br>

            Try a hairstyle that does not require this product.<br>
            <b>8.Pulling your hair back tightly, such as in a ponytail, bun, or cornrows. Changes that can help prevent
                hair damage:</b><br>

            Wear hair loosely pulled back.<br>
            Use covered rubber bands made especially for styling hair.<br>
            Try a different hairstyle that does not pull on your hair.<br>
            <b>9.Wearing a weave or hair extensions. Changes that can help prevent hair damage:</b><br>

            Wear weaves and extensions that are light, so they do not pull.<br>
            Get weaves and hair extensions at a salon that specializes in these services.<br>
            Wear a professional weave or hair extension for 2 or 3 months at most.<br>
            Keep up your scalp hygiene when wearing a weave or hair extension.<br>
            Switch hairstyles, so you don’t always wear a weave or hair extensions.<br>
            <b>10.Coloring, perming, or relaxing your hair. Changes that can help prevent hair damage: </b><br>

            Try to add more time between touch-ups, especially when the air is dry. In the winter, try to stretch the
            time between touch-ups to every 8 to 10 weeks or longer.<br>
            Have only one service — a coloring, relaxer, or perm. If you want more than one service, perm or relax your
            hair first, and do it 2 weeks before you color your hair.<br>
            Use conditioner after each shampoo.<br>
            When in the sun, protect your hair by using a leave-in conditioner that contains zinc oxide or wearing a
            wide-brimmed hat.<br>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">#Brushing your hair 100 strokes a day or tugging on your hair to style
            it. Changes that can help prevent hair damage:</h1><br>

        <p style="color:rgb(185, 45, 68)">Brush and comb your hair only to style it. Hair never needs 100 brush strokes
            a day. That’s a myth.<br>
            Use a wide-tooth comb, and use it gently to comb your hair.<br>
            Avoid pulling and tugging on your hair as you brush, comb, or style it.<br>
            Remove tangles gently, using a moisturizing conditioner if necessary.</p><br>
        <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">When to see a dermatologist:</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(185, 45, 68)">If changing how you care for your hair does not help you see healthier hair,
            you may want to see a board-certified dermatologist. Your hair care may not be the root cause of your
            problem. Seeing a dermatologist is especially important if you are concerned about thinning hair or hair
            loss. Most causes can be stopped or treated. The sooner the problem is addressed, the better your results.
